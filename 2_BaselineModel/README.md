# Baseline Model

Initially, we employed SSD ResNet101 V1 for object detection with reduced dimensions (320x320), as outlined in the pipeline config. Dissatisfied with the result (which is shown in the picture below), we opted for an alternative model, maintaining a similar approach for our object detection task.
